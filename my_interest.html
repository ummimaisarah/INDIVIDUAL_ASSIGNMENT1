<p class="interestdesc"> I don't watch korean series much! just randomly play this series on netflix, but this is exception. the more episode i seen .. i the more i am in love with the story line, characters of each role and many more.A paragliding mishap drops a South Korean heiress in North Korea - and into the life of an army officer, who decides he will help her hide. Crash Landing on You tells the story of two star-crossed lovers, Yoon Se-ri (Son Ye-jin), a South Korean fashion entrepreneur with her company Se-ri's Choice, and Ri Jeong-hyeok (Hyun Bin), a member of the North Korean elite and a Captain in the North Korean Special Police Force </p>

<p class="interestdesc" align="right"> It's an inspired Korean television production, with an enjoyable romantic plot, well written dialogue, good acting and adequate budget. As of April 2016 it has been streamed more than 2.3 billion times and its Asian success is so huge that China's Ministry of Public Security posted an official (and threatening) statement to warn against the growing influence of Korean Dramas on Chinese youth.It's obviously for kids but it can be interesting for anyone willing to know how is it to live now in South Korea, what does it mean to be pretty, young and cool there.But besides that, the story is catching and well made, with pleasant moments, nice sceneries (a great part has been shot in Greece) and good attention for details.Interestingly, Authors felt the need to account for the age difference between the beautiful Song Hye-kyo (born 1981) and the handsome Song Joong-ki (born 1985), even though I wonder how many of us would have noticed I'm liking it and I think that others from Western Countries will like it too. </p>

There’s a great fantasy story in place with a very capable cast. There are also a lot of twists and turns in W.
